<h1>Idle No More: Engines Quiet Down Outside Congestion Zone</h1>
<h2>NYC&#39s new traffic toll may be cutting more than just congestion, with plummeting idling violations just outside the zone.</h2>

    In the early months of the pandemic, public health professor Chris Hartmann stood working inside his neighborhod&#39s community garden on the Upper West Side and watched a shuttle-bus idle for several minutes, its exhaust clouding the air. He filed a complaint through New York City’s Citizen Air Complaint Program (CACP). The idling didn&#39t stop immediately, but it did taper off after the bus was ticketed.
</p>

<p>
    That scene reflects a broader shift. An analysis of the summons issued by the city&#39s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) data shows a sharp drop in idling violations in 2025, the same year New York&#39s congestion pricing zone went into effect.
</p>

<iframe title="[ OATH Summons for idling in Manhattan ]" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-69kx5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/69kx5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();</script>

<p>
    In the first four months of the year, neighborhoods just north of the congestion zone, such as Lincoln Square and the Upper West Side, saw only 12 summonses issued for idling, compared to 963 during the same period in 2024. That’s close to a 99% decline.
</p>

<p>
    Vehicle idling is more than a nuisance, it’s a known contributor to air pollution, releasing soot, particulate matter, and greenhouse gases like nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.
</p>

<p>
    When these pollutants interact with gasoline and diesel emissions in the presence of sunlight, they form a layer of ground-level ozone, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
</p>

<p>“This really matters. Study after study links vehicle pollution to asthma, cognitive decline, cardiovascular disease, just a whole host of terrible things,” ” said Hartmann, who teaches at SUNY Old Westbury.
</p>

<p>
    Since 2019, when the CACP launched, New Yorkers have been able to file video complaints about idling vehicles, often earning a cut of the resulting fines.
</p>

<p>
    Complaints in midtown Manhattan surged during the pandemic as fewer residents took to public transportation. After that, the summons rose consistently with a slight decline in 2021. 
Yet in 2025, the numbers have collapsed.

</p>

<p>
    Experts are hesitant to declare victory just yet. The complaints can take several months to be processed before a notice of violation or a summons is issued and a hearing date is set. 
</p>

<p>
    “The DEP (Department of Environmental Protection) does not review the complaints in order, sometimes reviewing ones about the same company before getting to individual complaints,” said a sustainability expert who is still waiting on a hearing date about idling complaints he sent out in August, 2024. 
</p>

<p>
    In other words, we may just be seeing a delay in enforcement data, not a real drop in violations.
</p>

<p>
    Still, for activists like Hartmann, this is a hopeful starting point. Since he began reporting idlers during the pandemic, he’s connected with a growing network of citizen enforcers.
</p>

<p>
    “We are everywhere,” he said. “The DEP doesn’t have the workforce, but we can be their eyes and ears, there’s 8 million of us.”
</p>

<p>
    He believes the drop in summonses reflects real behavioral change, not just bureaucratic lag. Complaints, he said, have risen year after year, not necessarily because idling has increased, but because more New Yorkers know about the program and are willing to participate.
</p>

<p>
    Hartmann estimates 180,000–200,000 complaints may be filed by the end of 2025.
</p>

<p>
    Another dataset, complaints logged via the city’s 311 system, tells a subtler story. While less dramatic, 311 data also shows a decline in idling, especially in Upper Manhattan.
</p>

<iframe title="[ 311 Idling Complaints above the Congestion Zone ]" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-myxVG" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/myxVG/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="416" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();</script>

<p>
    Unlike CACP data, which focuses on commercial vehicles, the 311 dataset skews toward private cars. Just around 8% of the 311 complaints specify vehicle type, with most identifying cars, then trucks. Most OATH-issued summonses on the other hand, go to major commercial operators like Con Edison, Verizon, and Amazon.
</p>

<p>
    The city’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) implemented congestion pricing in January 2025 to reduce traffic and pollution in Midtown Manhattan. The sharp drop in idling complaints just outside the zone raises the possibility that congestion pricing is having spillover effects.
</p>

<p>
    A DEP spokesperson said they were unable to provide further details about idling complaints when contacted via email.
